The RESPIRE (Respiration of Sinking Particles In the subsuRface ocEan) is a particle interceptor/incubator that allows to non-intrusively intercept settling particles at fixed depths, and immediately incubate them within this device at the in situ pressure and temperature. RESPIRE provides rates of remineralization by particle-attached bacteria based on an oxygen consumption time-series (Boyd et al. 2015; Bressac et al. 2019).
