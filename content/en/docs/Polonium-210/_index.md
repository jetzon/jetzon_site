  An introduction to the use of Polonium-210 as a tracer of sinking particles in the ocean

The method is very similar to that of <a href="/docs/thorium-234">Thorium-234</a>.
Polonium-210 (<sup>210</sup>Po) is a naturally occurring radionuclide in the ocean, mainly formed from decay of its Lead-210 “parent” which is delivered to the oceans via atmospheric deposition, weathering and rivers. Like <sup>234</sup>Th, lower levels of <sup>210</sup>Po than <sup>210</sup>Pb means more of the Polonium that is attached to the sinking particles is being removed. Then, downward <sup>210</sup>Po flux can be estimated. These same particles carry organic carbon and associated elements from the surface to the deep sea. If carbon and polonium are measured on the same particles, sinking flux of polonium can be converted into flux of carbon, which is a key parameter in considering the ocean’s role in the global carbon cycle and climate.
The differences between <sup>210</sup>Po and <sup>234</sup>Th are their biogeochemical properties - unlike thorium Polonium is assimilated by some phytoplankton and bacteria- and their radioactive half-lives – a longer half-life of <sup>210</sup>Po implies that water column sampling can be affected by previous export events.
