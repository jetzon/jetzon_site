### Joint Exploration of the Twilight Zone Ocean Network!

{{< imgproc TZ_observations Resize "600x">}}
<b>State of the art for observing the twilight zone.</b> Methods include (a) autonomous sampling and observing e.g. via floats and gliders, (b) ship-based measurements, and (c) remote sensing. Exciting new insights are being increasingly made through (1) omics and (2) optics (e.g. in situ cameras and backscatter sensors).

The ocean's Twilight Zone, the dimly led region extending from a few hundred meters depth to 1000 m, is still poorly understood from almost any perspective, whether physics, biochemistry or ecology. However, it contains possibly the world's largest and least exploited fish stock and is responsible for recycling roughly 80% of the organic material that enters the ocean's interior from productive surface waters. The former has drawn attention due to increasing demand for resources from a growing world population.There is therefore a pressing need to understand the consequences of perturbing this ecosystem.

JETZON was set up to address the question: how can we as an international scientific community obtain the greatest insight into the Twilight Zone from ongoing work and how can we maintain focus on this potentially threatened environment?

JETZON has to origin in the BIARRITZ (Bridging International Activity and Related Research Into the Twilight Zone) workshop in July 2019, funded by the National Environmental Research Council (UK), NASA, OCB, and SCOR. The workshop brought together 13 international projects tacking aspects of the Twilight Zone's role and function, from viruses to fish.
